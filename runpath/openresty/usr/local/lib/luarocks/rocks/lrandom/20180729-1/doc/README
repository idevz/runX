This is a random-number library for Lua. It is based on the Mersenne Twister
random number generator available at
	http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html

To build the library and run a simple test, just do make.
If Lua is not installed in /usr/local, tell make:
	make LUA_TOPDIR=/var/tmp/lhf/lua-5.3.5/install

To install the library where Lua can find it, use a variant of these:
	make install
	sudo make install
	sudo make install LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3

For detailed installation instructions, see
	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

The library is simple and intuitive; see the summary below.
Read test.lua to see the library in action.
